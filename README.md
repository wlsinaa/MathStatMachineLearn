## Introduction


In this study, predicting revenue of movie is performed using linear regression, LASSO, ridge regression and tree-based method, such as decision tree and bagging. The result is that tree-based out-perform the classical linear regression especially using boosting and bagging. During the study,coefficient of determination is a criterion for evaluating the model. Hypothesis was performed in this study.
